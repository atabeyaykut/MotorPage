# React Development Standards and Best Practices

## 1. UI and Design Standards

### ShadCN Components
- Use shadcn components as much as possible for consistent, customizable and reusable UI elements
- Import components from "@/components/ui" when using shadcn/ui

### Tailwind CSS
- Take a utility-first approach to design
- Use the @apply directive to avoid excessive repetition of classes
- Ensure responsive design and mobile compatibility

## 2. Code Structure and Architecture

### Functional Components & React Hooks
- Use functional components with modern ES6+ syntax
- Optimize lifecycle and state management with React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, etc.)
- Use plain JavaScript instead of TypeScript
- Do not use React StrictMode

### Modularity
- Break components into logical, reusable parts
- Organize file and folder structure in an organized, readable and scalable way

### State Management
- Choose Context API or Zustand for small and medium-sized applications
- Use Redux Toolkit or similar for complex applications with global state requirements

## 3. Accessibility and Semantics

### Semantic HTML
- Use appropriate HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO
- Add ARIA tags and roles where necessary

### Keyboard and Screen Reader Support
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Apply screen reader-friendly design principles

## 4. Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading & Code Splitting
- Use dynamic imports to avoid unnecessary code loading
- Implement React.lazy and Suspense for component lazy loading

### Memoization
- Reduce unnecessary renders with useMemo and useCallback

### Caching
- Implement SWR or React Query for API data caching

## 5. Code Quality and Standards

### Clean Code Principles
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use meaningful variable, function and component names

### Documentation
- Add comments for complex functions, algorithms and critical code
- Provide API documentation using JSDoc or similar

### Linting and Formatting
- Use ESLint, Prettier and Stylelint for code standards
- Include static analysis in CI/CD processes

## 6. Test Strategy

### Unit and Integration Testing
- Write tests for critical components using Jest and React Testing Library

### E2E Testing
- Verify user flows with Cypress or Playwright

### Test Continuity
- Automate test runs in development phases (pre-commit hooks, CI/CD)

## 7. Security Measures

### Input Validation
- Sanitize and validate all user input
- Configure firewall and CORS policies correctly

### Dependency Management
- Perform regular dependency updates
- Monitor for vulnerabilities

### Security Testing
- Conduct periodic application penetration tests

## 8. Router and Navigation

### React Router v6
- Implement consistent routing with React Router v6
- Configure dynamic and protected routes properly

### Navigation Flow
- Create intuitive navigation prioritizing user experience

## 9. DevOps and Continuity

### CI/CD Integration
- Automate test, build and deploy processes
- Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or Jenkins

### Code Review
- Implement peer-review for pull requests
- Use automated code review tools

## 10. Additional Tools and Advanced Applications

### Rendering Strategies
- Consider SSR or SSG needs with Next.js or similar frameworks

### API Design
- Centralize HTTP clients (Axios, Fetch)
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms

### Monitoring
- Integrate error reporting and performance monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)

### Version Control
- Follow Conventional Commits standards
- Implement Git Flow or similar branch strategy
